# MAC_address_changer
This is a project work i started in order to learn python while creating ethical hacking tools and this is my first project on that journey! 

This foundations of this project comes from the ifconig commands offered by the linux. 
I have used supprocess to run those commans in python. 

This gives the user complete power as to give command line arguments for interface and mac address input.

The User can also use the --help command to understand the options provided by the command and how it shall be used.

The command line arguments are being passed using optParse library and the function called optionparser. 

The current mac address is extracted using RegEx. 

You can input either interfaces as you like i.e. eth0 or Wlan0.

P.s. This is a very basic level project hence the code is pretty naive for anyone to understand.
